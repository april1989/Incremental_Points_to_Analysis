## Incremental Points-to Analysis: Adopted by WALA [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/april1989/Incremental_Points_to_Analysis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/april1989/Incremental_Points_to_Analysis)

This is the main source repository for the incremental points-to analysis, developed by Automated Software Engineering Research (ASER) Group at Texas A&M University. Currently, we support context/flow-insensitive and object/field-sensitive points-to analysis. The source code is in ```edu.tamu.wala.increpta```, and the tests are in ```edu.tamu.wala.increpta.tests```. 

### Get Started
#### Prerequisites:
- Java >= 1.8
- Eclipse >= Mars 4.5.2
- Apache Maven >= 3.3.9
#### Set Up
1. ```git clone https://github.com/april1989/Incremental_Points_to_Analysis.git```
2. With Maven: 
```cd path-to-the-clone-folder```
```mvn clean install -DskipTests=true```
3. With Eclipse:
Import the projects in this repo to a new Eclipse workspace;
Follow the instructions on the "UserGuide: Getting Started":http://wala.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/UserGuide:Getting_Started to set up WALA.

#### Example
Firstly, we run the points-to analysis for the whole target program, which has the same code structure as provided by WALA points-to analysis framework:
```java
//Indicate analysis scope for the target program and excluded packages
AnalysisScope scope = AnalysisScopeReader.readJavaScope(Scope_File, (new FileProvider()).getFile(Exclusion_Packages), Example.class.getClassLoader());
ClassHierarchy cha = ClassHierarchyFactory.make(scope);
//Compute entrypoints in the scope
Iterable<Entrypoint> entrypoints = Util.makeMainEntrypoints(scope, cha);
AnalysisOptions options = CallGraphTestUtil.makeAnalysisOptions(scope, entrypoints);
IAnalysisCacheView cache = new AnalysisCacheImpl();
//Create incremental call graph/points-to graph builder, and compute the graphs for the whole target program
IPASSAPropagationCallGraphBuilder builder = IPAUtil.makeIPAZeroCFABuilder(options, cache, cha, scope);
CallGraph callGraph = builder.makeCallGraph(options, null);
PointerAnalysis<InstanceKey> pta = builder.getPointerAnalysis();
```
where```Exclusion_Packages``` includes all the packages excluded from the analysis, and ```Scope_File``` indicates the target program.

Then, user need to specify two sets: ```delInsts``` to store all the deleted SSAInstructions, ```addInsts``` to store all the added onces, and ```targetNode``` denotes which CGNode the instructions belong to.
```java
CGNode targetNode = null;
HashSet<SSAInstruction> delInsts = new HashSet<>();
HashSet<SSAInstruction> addInsts = new HashSet<>();
```

Finally, user call ```updatePointsToAnalysis()``` with the above parameters to run our incremental analysis. Afterwards, user can query the updated points-to sets by ```getPointsToSet()```.
```java
//Perform the incremental points-to analysis
builder.updatePointsToAnalysis(targetNode, delInsts, addInsts);
//Query the points-to set of pointerKey
OrdinalSet<InstanceKey> pts = pta.getPointsToSet(pointerKey);
```

### Run the Junit Tests
The JUnit test file is in ```edu.tamu.wala.increpta.tests```. The test cases includeds all the test cases in ```com.ibm.wala.core.testdata/src/demandpa``` for pointer analysis. 

You can checkout the projects in the master branch, and import them into Eclipse. Locate the JUnit test (```edu.tamu.wala.increpta.tests```) and run as JUnit test. There are two potential problems during the test:
- Unsupported major.minor version 52.0, please go to _Run Configuration_ -> JRE -> Alternative -> Java 8, and then run it. 
- If you would like to build the whole wala project in this repo, please download the DroidBench and add the path in ```wala.properties```.

You can also run maven script to build the project by ```mvn clean install```, or ```mvn clean install -DskipTests``` to skip the tests.

### Test Methodology
For each test case, we initially compute the whole program points-to analysis, record the points-to set for each variable in a map. Then, we start to check the correctness of the incremental pointer analysis:
1. Delete an SSAInstruction, compute the affected points-to sets;
2. Add back the SSAInstruction, compute the affected points-to sets and record the changed variables
3. For each changed variable, we compare the points-to sets between the one stored in the map and the one after (2). If they are the same, it means we correctly updated the points-to graph. Otherwise, it violates the assertion.

### Parallelization
The incremental points-to analysis can be embarassingly paralleled to improve the performance. For the parallel version, please change ```edu.tamu.wala.increpta.ipa.callgraph.propagation.IPAPropagationSystem.nrOfWorkers```, which indicates the number of threads to perform parallel works.

### About WALA
The main repositry for WALA is https://github.com/wala/WALA. For more details on WALA, see <a
href="http://wala.sourceforge.net">the WALA home page</a> and <a href="https://wala.github.io/javadoc">WALA Javadoc</a>.

**Note:** historically, WALA has used Maven as its build system.
However, this WALA branch can also use Gradle as an alternative to
Maven.  See [the Gradle-specific README](README-Gradle.md) for more
instructions and helpful tips.
